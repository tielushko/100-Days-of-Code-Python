## Who's Paying

# Instructions

You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill. 

**Important**: You are not allowed to use the `choice()` function.

Don't worry about the lines 3/4 it's there to allow us to test your code.

**Line 8** splits the string `namesAsCSV` into individual names and puts them inside a **List** called `names`.
